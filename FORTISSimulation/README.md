Simulation of Oracle and Bold Mining Attacks on FORTIS and Freshness Preferred Mining Algorihtms based on Blocksim  https://github.com/carlosfaria94/blocksim/tree/master/blocksim

-Nodes can be set from Inputs_Config.py file along with their hashing powes. If a node is not honest, the types "oracle" or "bold" needs to be declared.

-Choice of Fortis or FP is also declared from Inputs_Config.py.

-To alter the block propagation delay search for the function receive_block_time.
